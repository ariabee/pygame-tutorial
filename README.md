# pygame-tutorial group assignment

We used the Python Pygame tutorial provided by https://coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/ to build a small Pygame application, with an additional feature.

## Additional Feature: Multiplayer cars
The standard car-avoids-enemy-cars game is now a two-player endeavor. A second player controls a car using the a and d keys for left and right motion. Both cars must avoid collision with the enemy vehicles in order to keep the game going.

## How to Use (Development)
- Have python installed. Check https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for details.
- Have pygame installed. Check https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for details.

## How to Use (to Play!)
- Be sure to have python and pygame installed. Check https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for details.
- Download the project files or clone the project locally.
- Using terminal or other command line interface launch `python3 Game.py`.
