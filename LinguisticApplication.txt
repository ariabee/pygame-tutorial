One possible application we thought about would be doing classical linguistic experiments in a more engaging way. Instead of hearing a sentence and then pressing a soulless button, you can instead hear a sentence and then move a little guy to a certain position on screen and interact more organicly with the study. That approach might lead to more relaxes, natural approaches instead of the usual formal setting of linguistic experiments.
